# My Personal Project

## WeightPacer

A *bulleted* list:

***What will the application do?***
- The application will be a weight pacer that you can measure your own mass every day, 
  then record your mass in the interface (and logs it in the list of masses that you 
  inputted throughout your campaign). We will follow this process until you reach your goal. 
    
  I will ***try*** to implement a system that makes the user adhere to a set rate of losing weight. 
  To add on to this, say after some time if you're not losing enough weight or, you're losing 
  weight too fast, the system will try to post some medical related advice to help them.

***Who will use it?***
- Anyone who wants to get involved in a campaign to lose weight, can all use this program. 
  Anyone that wants to make a change in their lifestyle or improve their quality of life would 
  be more than welcome to use this program. Physical activity and healthy eating is a must-have 
  for each person's daily routine. 
  
  While I will only just focus on just the pace of the loss of weight itself, this 
  program can be further developed by including factors like what you eat and how you eat, as well as 
  how much exercise (including what kind of exercise) did one do each day to give the user a more 
  accurate rate of loss/gain or maintaining mass. I can also factor in things like height and age 
  later on to help have a more accurate program for the user.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***
- The reason why I chose to take on this kind of project is that I too also have tried 
  to have a weight loss program for myself a few times. While I have been able to lose
  weight, on the other hand there hasn't been any resources that has been accessible and 
  not behind a paywall. When I try to log down my weight loss, it can be a really cumbersome
  and a tough task. This program will be created to make the process of focusing on one's 
  weight pacer program more streamlined, so they can stick to focusing on their campaign!

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
